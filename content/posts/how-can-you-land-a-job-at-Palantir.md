**TLDR: Aim high, network a lot.**

On 15th December 2022 I accepted a Forward Deployed Engineer role at Palantir. It was by the time of hiring freezes across Big Tech so I consider that quite a success. I always dreamt working in an exciting tech company like Google or Netflix. Some say it’s harder to get to Palantir than to Google and the company is famous of hiring top talents from worldwide renowned universities. I do not have such a educational background. I do not have many years of experience neither.

How can you follow suit, and work in a place you feel is the right one for you?

I will break my recipe into 2 parts:

1. **Attitude**. Top companies hire top people. Work hard and adopt a **can-do attitude**. Motivation is really, really important. Get your degree, be curious, build challenging projects, get some industry experience. Don’t forget to grind leetcode-like questions if you're aiming to be a SWE. In the end you are a top person, in your own unique way. Just as the journey to the moon required multiple steps and attempts, achieving our career goals often involves taking increments and persevering through challenges. Some people are being reached out directly by recruiters but that requires a solid work experience or a strong degree.

2. **Network**. The more I progress in my professional life the more I realise how **crucial your network is**. I heard so many times, from YouTube coaches, authors and peers about significance of networking, yet never felt it directly until recently. Your network isn't just about the connections you've made on LinkedIn or a superficial professional circle of acquaintances. It's also about the genuine relationships you've built with people who share your interests and passions - your true friends and allies. Imagine you have your own startup and there is a hiring decision. You can either open a junior position and filter 200 random applicants or interview your employees friend, which they recommended to you as a bright and ambitious individual. The choice is simple.

**How did it look like for me?**

I went to the best university I could, I was building more projects than required (sometimes literally coding 12 hours a day). I got my first tech role during my second year. The first company allowed me to solidify my engineering and soft skills. It was a great place yet I still had FAANG at the end of my head. After sending dozens of applications, I got an internship at Amazon. Palantir takes reference seriously, and I was referred by a good friend of mine I met there. Internships are usually easier to secure, and provide you with immense opportunities for networking or landing the offer directly.

As anything in life, success is a combination of hard work and luck. The more connections you have, the more time you can save in career development, as networking can open up opportunities more quickly. Thanks for reading it all untill here, I hope you'll find these advices useful. Don't hesitate to reach me out through socials if there's anything more worth discussing. Please note I tried to make this post as generic as possible, purposely omitting the Palantir interview process nuances.
